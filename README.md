Here you can get the code of the server.js for testing you application.

If you wish to use the same code which I have then you may proceed with git clone 

Open up ur terminal and given the following command,

```
git clone https://github.com/narenltk/forever_node_js.git
```

then you need to install and check your local machine,

```
npm install
```

Once your done with all the steps given above all you to do is just fire up the server, with the following command and check your local host

```
npm start

or

node server.js
```

Now checkout "https://localhost:2020"

I have used the port 2020 and you can change the port to any number you like.
